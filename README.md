# Open In Cursor

Open the current file in Cursor editor.

The text editing experience of Sublime Text is unparalled. It is a beautiful piece of software. It is like using one's "good pen" and "good paper" to write. It is you and your code.

I consider Sublime Text to be a text editor, not an IDE. I do not want to turn it into an IDE. I want to keep it pure. However, sometimes I do want to pop into Cursor for it's features.

This plugin allows you to open the current file in Cursor. If a project folder is available, opens with project context. Otherwise opens just the single file in a new window.
